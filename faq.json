      "question": "How to setup my Thermostat?",
      "answer": "The thermostat setting method: A standard mechanical thermostat is typically used indoors. A small round box is placed on a short wall near the floor-to-ceiling window in the living room. On the left side of the box is a 'cool-off-heat' switch; this switch cools in summer and heats in winter. On the right side of the box is the fan switch, set to automatic. In the center of the box is a disc with semi-circular graduations at the top and bottom. The top graduation shows the set temperature, and the bottom graduation shows the current temperature. Behind the wall is another switch to set the fan speed.",
